Thanks for giving this opportunity, my name is kiran daraveni living in Hyderabad and currently I am eamployed  with wipro ltd as AWS and security engineer. I have overall 7 yrs experience in IT ON AWS I have around 5 years’ experience and certified aws soilution architech
My day to day responsibilities like my day start with servicenow tickets, first we will check if there is any priority request in que IF IT IS we will try to resolve them ASAP As per SLA, here we will receive the tickets like provisioning maintaining  and decommissioning AWS resources like EC2 s3 vpc lamda loadbalncers , route53 and all other services like compute, storage, Security identity and compliance ,database networking and content delivey. In my company we wont encourage to create manually process we will use aws service catalog to provisioning the resources by passing the required parameters, I do work on End user computing like  aws appstream and aws workspaces 
Apart from this general cases we usually receives the tickets on monitoring and troubleshooting cases like cpu utilization high, spikes in the load balncer, user unable to access the resources like that and all other security related tickets like malicious  activities, here we are using two 3rd party security services integrated with AWS which are Ermetic and wiz
Ermetic is a Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Manage (CIEM) solutions application automate the process of managing user authentication  and privileges in cloud environments
Wiz is a (CSPM) Cloud security posture management is a security tools designed to identify misconfiguration issues and compliance risks in the cloud
This both security tools scan the environment and analyses the risks based on the severity so we do work on this tickets with the remediation steps provided by the tool.
